Gunther Schletter

Working with R and Python for a few months, shifting much more heavily to python. Working through online tutorials and looking to incorporate python specifically
for data visualization, automation, statistical analysis, and arcpy. 

Still in the introductory phase so any recommended training materials is greatly appreciated!
